### Traffic Simulation:
Implemented the single lane, variable-speed traffic model described in [https://course-resources.minerva.kgi.edu/uploaded_files/mke/YpqvNV/nagel-schreckenberg.pdf](Nagel), K.,Schreckenberg, M. (1992) as well as the 2-lane, symmetric, uni-directional, variable speed model in [https://course-resources.minerva.kgi.edu/uploaded_files/mke/00100888-7879/rickert-et-al.pdf](Rickert), M., et al. (1996). Analyzed how much more traffic can flow through a multi-lane road, compared to a single lane road, at the same traffic density. Presented my results in a report.

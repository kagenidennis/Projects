### Social Dynamics Model:
Implemented an extension to a social dynamics model covered in class to explore the interaction between peopleâ€™s preferences or opinions and the strength of their social connections by proposing modifications to the model to make the dynamics more realistic; implemented my improvements in a simulation, and analyzed the expected (theoretical) and actual (experimental) effects of my changes on the model.

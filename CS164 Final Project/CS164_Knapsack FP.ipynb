In doing so, a search tree, also known as a branch-and-bound tree, is constructed where each node in the tree corresponds to a particular subregion of the feasible region. The idea is to avoid complete enumeration by calculating a lower bound on the value of the best possible solution in the\n",

        "\n",
        "**Bound:** Given a solution set, get an upper/lower bound estimate of the best solution that can be found in the solution set. For example, one can find an upper bound for a 0‚Äì1 knapsack problem by solving its corresponding fractional knapsack problem. Since fractional knapsack problem allows selecting a fraction of an item while 0‚Äì1 knapsack problem does not, fractional knapsack problem will always yield an equal or better objective value, which can be seen as an upper bound on the objective of the 0‚Äì1 knapsack problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Branch:** While computing bounds on the solution set, we encounter solutions which satisfy all constraints of the problem, but not feasible because the solution values are not integers. In this case we can branch on one of the fractional value variables ‚Äî splitting the current solution space into two: (in the binary variable case) one that enforces the fractional value variables to be 0, and the other enforces the fractional value variable to be 1. For example, solving the fractional knapsack problem may yield a solution that takes 50% of item 2. One can then branch on item 2‚Äôs variable by splitting the solution space to either include item 2 or not include item 2.\n",
